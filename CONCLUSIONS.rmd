# Conclusions and remarks

(`under construction`)

???RESEARCH QUESTIONS

The answer is yes, you should, but... you need, according with this work, to take in account some crucial remarks, that related to the outcames and the risks, namely: 

1. In general, students will benefit from moving to an inductive methodology and, particularly, the 4C/ID used here;
2. Students transfer TEST and LAB improve in general;
3. Student's behavior suffers a little loss;
4. 8 graders benefit more...
5. Gender...
6. put the learning responsablity on the student...
7. When changing the methodology, some students feel lost: it's important to give some text support, using books or written documents (called Supportive information in 4C/ID methodology), in order for students to have a logical work flow line to follow.
8. Motivation and understanding improve, not only because of practical, hands-on, LAB activities but because students understand what the teacher discourse meanings is, when listening.Â´
9. The use of intensive ??? for learning objectives??? create a sense of control and the joy of achievement.

Remarks:
10. If you are using also bLearning you should be part of a team: it's overwhelming for one person alone, to manage, organize, create content, plan and assess the learning flux;
11. Using bLearning improves the time of individual exchange??? because the teacher can use their time to help students while they are following the online activities (MOODLE lessons, ????)
12. There is a descent curve starting in 2014 that can't be explained by the methodology difference
13. questions and other research paths????

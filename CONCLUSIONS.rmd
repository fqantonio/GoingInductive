# CONCLUSIONS and REMARKS

(`under construction`)

The inner goal of a teacher is always to have their students engaged in their subject, to have them wanted to know more, and tease their curiosity towards life and knowledge in general. The idea of changing the methodological strategy was compelling, not only because it seems a more natural way, more BBL suitable, to address the Science subject wording by adopting this 4C/ID learning flux strategy, but also to engage in its conceptual and mental model, that is, improve learning. So, when introducing concepts, there was a neuro network of lab experiences that facilitate that understanding, so important in Science subjects. What were the consequences for the student's academic results?


???RESEARCH QUESTIONS

The conclusions presented here focus on the junior sample of school 1 (table above). 

**Overall**, as a teacher of science and tech, you should move to implement the inductive strategy as your methodology for learning because it improves the **academic results** with a huge impact on **lab practice**.

However there are risks and concerns to be accommodated during the process, namely: 

  1. the less adapted to the school system;
  2. in the **behavior** aspect of the classroom managment and in the **learning transfer**;
  3. in less degree of concern, Grade 7 and males seems to benefit less from this change.

**Bottom of line**, if you don't want to have the less risks as possible, change if you have a student group more adapted to school and if you want to increase the lab practices skills.

RISKS:
  1. In the **learning transfer** and **academic results**, there is the risk that the less adapted to the school environment suffer more with this strategic change;
  2. For **behavior**, specifically in aspect of following social and behavioral classroom rules, there is a major negative [^???] impact in all samples: the risk of loosing control of the students group inside the classroom is real, but in this case, the assessment were all positive: median change from 81 to 74%, which means that the behavior was above 50% and didn't represent a thread to the classroom learning environment;

CONCERNS:
  1. There seems to be a positive effect only in GRADE 8 and FEMALE groups for the **learning transfer**, the other groups the change don't have any effect. 
  2. On the **behavior field** only grade 9 seems to get some positive effect;
  3. In general, Female gender group tend to benefit more them male;
  4. In general, RANK 3 tends to benefit more then the other rank groups;
  5. grade 9th benefit more then the other grades;
  
BENEFITS:
  1. In overall, the change has a positive impact on junior grade students for the **academic results**; 
  2. **Lab practice** has a large positive effect in all samples;

------------------------------

The answer is yes, you should, but... you need, according with this work, to take in account some crucial remarks, that related to the outcames and the risks, namely: 

1. In general, students will benefit from moving to an inductive methodology and, particularly, the 4C/ID used here;
2. Students transfer TEST and LAB improve in general;
3. Student's behavior suffers a little loss;
4. 8 graders benefit more...
5. Gender...
6. put the learning responsablity on the student...
7. When changing the methodology, some students feel lost: it's important to give some text support, using books or written documents (called Supportive information in 4C/ID methodology), in order for students to have a logical work flow line to follow.
8. Motivation and understanding improve, not only because of practical, hands-on, LAB activities but because students understand what the teacher discourse meanings is, when listening.Â´
9. The use of intensive ??? for learning objectives??? create a sense of control and the joy of achievement.

Remarks:
10. If you are using also bLearning you should be part of a team: it's overwhelming for one person alone, to manage, organize, create content, plan and assess the learning flux;
11. Using bLearning improves the time of individual exchange??? because the teacher can use their time to help students while they are following the online activities (MOODLE lessons, ????)
12. There is a descent curve starting in 2014 that can't be explained by the methodology difference
13. questions and other research paths????

It seems that the 4CID effect is not positive for all the variables neither for the overall perspective it seems that school 0 as better TEST grades them school 2, while there a jump when the 4CID is implemented; That is not so obvious for the LAB variable. Clearly that the BEHAV variable suuffers a loss with the implementation of 4CID. for the CLASS variable, after a positive effect it goes down, perhaps following the BEHAV variable only the LAB variable show an increase. The red dot and the skewness showed in figure 7, show that could be no positive overall 4C/ID effect and the sample are not normal, which corroborate upper analysis

Overall, over time, it seems that there is a negative 4C/ID effect. 
However, R^2 values are very weak. It can be seen that a school effect could be undeway these R2 low doesn't mean that the variables are dependent nor the 
There is some degree of correlation that doesn't permit to conclude of the variable dependency
The clear correlation between TEST and CLASS variable show that they are dependent and Kendal correlation test corroborates that variables are dependent but with a levell degree arround 20 to 40%: not high; meaning that the way the variables are assessed are different. They correlate, but at a low levell, showing a bad levell, which means that they were assessed with different techniques.the class test correlation is just a refence that we know, in advance, that there is a math relationship

data seems to be not normal, except the CLASS variable sample data don't behav as a normal distribution under both tests, nor if we do the same analysis for the school 0 and shcool 1. Meaning that we should use a non-parametric . diferent SAMPLES for the 4C/ID treatment effect
sample data don't behav as a normal distribution under both tests, nor if we do the same analysis for the school 0 and shcool 1. Meaning that we should use a non-parametric

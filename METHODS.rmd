# METHODS



The conclusion was based on the usual statistical analysis and qualitative assessement notes using data from the usual day-to-day teacher database, spreadsheets assessments, notes, registers, inquiries, and teacher interactions with the students. This work, as well as the raw data, is also presented on the blog “https://4cidchange.edublogs.org/” and in this GitHub account. The quantitative assessment used statistical inference made with R software tool [^4] and is based on three learning outcomes: transfer tests (TEST), behavior (BEHAV), and lab skills (LAB). Two groups are compared groups, with and without the application of 4CID methodology (M4CID), in GENDER, RANK and SCHOOL. 

Goals
Describe the methods
no normal, Wilcox
errors not normal, no heterochedasticity???, no Regression discontinuity design
??? Triangulation ???
??? Balance methods ???

Conclusion: samples not normal but idenpendent: so, non-parametric inferene: wilcoxon can be used because of independency

# Software

In this work, I use R in the RStudio distribution. Mostly because it's "free" but also because it's really adaptable to what we want to do.

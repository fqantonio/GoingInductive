The **procedure** taken for the instructional design of this bLearning enviroment setting was done with cmap tools ([My Cmaps Cloud](https://cmapcloud.ihmc.us/cmaps/myCmaps.html)). The maps conceived contains the 4C/ID theoretical structure in the first step that was developed after a first trial for a real but small learning structure which was used to reelaborate that theoretical setting that followed several feedback loops until that 4C/ID structure was clear to be used for a first real learning course. Of course, each time the 4C/ID cmap was used in a new course or learning content some adjustments were made but just with the idea of making easire a clearer the use of those theoretical 4C/ID maps. 

Those maps contains all the guides proposed by 4C/ID of MerriÃ«nboer, already embeded in the CLT theory, and they show the two main lines of work while using them: in time, with the broadening of practice, simple "real-life" concrete activities towards concepts and conceptualization, new problems and contexts, with the idea of schema learning, step by step, in small amounts with supportive information, dealing with the germane load interactivity element, progressing towards radom practice (new task classes (TC) contexts), fading the guidance and delayed feedback; and down, meaning, showing the possible learning paths, fullfilled with just in time information, fading guidance, promoting procedure automation, with fading feedback, into the increasing complexity of the subject in a specific TC.

The idea of the use of cmaptools where concerned with the fact that, using complex "real-life" tasks has important implications (Plass et all, 2010, p.126) for the instructional design. The first is the cognitively demanding of the tasks meaning a great instrinsic load to deal with. This means "cutting" the interactivity within the tasks making them more understandable and cognitively friendly in the first contact with the avoindance of extraneous load as much as possible.

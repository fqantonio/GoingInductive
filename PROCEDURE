**In practice**, the prodedure underlying of the pedagogic planning, was the **4C/ID** of Merrionboer that provides a consistent means of managment of instructional sequences. This model 
provides the methodology for analysis of complex cognitive skills and development of appropriate sequences of whole-tasks learning situations that support gradual aqcquisition of these 
skills in a cognitively sustained manner. The procedure takes into account the limited processing capacity of working memory by gradually increasing the level of difficulty of whole tasks. 
According to this methodology, learning tasks for complex environments are organized in simple to complex sequence of task classe, with gradually dimishing levels of support within each 
class (scafolding). Suficient supportive information is provided for general aspects of learning tasks, and just-in-time information engage students in automation for the learning goals. 
Also part-time-task-practce is offered to train constituent skills that needed to be performed at a very high level of automaticity, Kalyuga (Pass et all, 2010). Moreover, this all 
methodoly also followed a concrete-to-abstract partner promoting the aquisition of higher level of conceptual schemas. During the planning the focus was on intrinsic and extraneous load 
rather then germane load, mostly because the goal was focus on the content rather then the student, that is, focus on making small learning steps with guidance and feedback capability 
in an variability problem environment. Germane load is considerered in CLT as the mental resources dedicated to processing, constructing, and automating schemas, so the dual framework of 
intrinsic and extraneous load is sufficient and non-redundant, making the boundaries of the theory clearer and the also the concrete field implementation (Kalyuga, 2011).

The **procedure** taken for the instructional design of this bLearning enviroment setting was done with cmap tools ([My Cmaps Cloud](https://cmapcloud.ihmc.us/cmaps/myCmaps.html)). The maps 
conceived contains the 4C/ID theoretical structure in the first step that was developed after a first trial for a real but small learning structure which was used to reelaborate that theoretical 
setting that followed several feedback loops until that 4C/ID structure was clear to be used for a first real learning course. Of course, each time the 4C/ID cmap was used in a new course or 
learning content some adjustments were made but just with the idea of making easire a clearer the use of those theoretical 4C/ID maps. Those maps contains all the guides proposed by 4C/ID of 
MerriÃ«nboer, already embeded in the CLT theory, and they show the two main lines of work while using them: in time, with the broadening of practice, concrete activities towards concepts and 
conceptualization, new problems and contexts, with the idea of schema learning, step by step, in small amounts with supportive information; and down, meaning, showing the possible paths, 
fullfilled with just in time information, fading guidance, promoting procedure automation, into the increasing complexity of the subject.

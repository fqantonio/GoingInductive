The **procedure** taken for the instructional design of this bLearning enviroment setting was done with cmap tools 
([My Cmaps Cloud](https://cmapcloud.ihmc.us/cmaps/myCmaps.html)). The maps conceived contains the 4C/ID theoretical structure in the first step that 
was developed after a first trial for a real but small learning structure which was used to reelaborate that theoretical setting that followed several 
feedback loops until that 4C/ID structure was clear to be used for a first real learning course. Of course, each time the 4C/ID cmap was used in a 
new course or learning content some adjustments were made but just with the idea of making easire a clearer the use of those theoretical 4C/ID maps. 
Those maps contains all the guides proposed by 4C/ID of MerriÃ«nboer, already embeded in the CLT theory, and they show the two main lines of work while 
using them: in time, with the broadening of practice, concrete activities towards concepts and conceptualization, new problems and contexts, with the 
idea of schema learning, step by step, in small amounts with supportive information; and down, meaning, showing the possible paths, fullfilled with 
just in time information, fading guidance, promoting procedure automation, into the increasing complexity of the subject.

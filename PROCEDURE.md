The **procedure** taken for the instructional design was done with cmap tools ([My Cmaps Cloud](https://cmapcloud.ihmc.us)). Cmap tools is an online tool were you can organize and develop concept maps about the learning structure tasks and paths, to be implemented in the LMS and in classroom settings. Several attemps were made, first on paper and afterwards with the software. The maps conceived contains the 4C/ID conceptual structure (see figure 0 in the Theory session) and were developed after the first trials of using this tools in a real but small learning structure which was used to reelaborate that theoretical setting and help in the learning curve that followed several feedback loops until that 4C/ID structure was clear to be used for a first real learning course. Each time the 4C/ID cmap was used in a new course or learning content, some adjustments were made, with the idea of making it easier and clearer to use, but also with more details and components.

Those maps contains all the guides proposed by Merriënboer 4C/ID, already embeded by the CLT theory, and they show the two main lines of work while using them: **in time**, horinzontaly, with the broadening of practice, simple "real-life" concrete activities towards concepts and conceptualization, using new problems and contexts, with the idea of schema learning, step by step, in small amounts, with supportive information, dealing with the germane load interactivity element, progressing towards radom practice (new task classes (TC) contexts), fading guidance and delayed feedback; **and down, in complexity**, vertically, meaning, showing the possible learning paths, fullfilled with just in time information, fading guidance, promoting procedure automation with fading feedback, into increasing complexity of the subject in a specific TC.

The idea of the use of cmaptools where concerned with the fact that, from the point of view of the instructional designer, there is a need to have a light house, a plan, that helps in the demanding coordination of all activities, namely, keeping the strategies in place, finding anchors, identifying simultaneity and sequencing, using complex "real-life" tasks (Plass et all, 2010, p.126), deal with cognitively demanding tasks meaning, tackling with the instrinsic load, "cutting" interactivity, making them more understandable, user friendly with avoindance of extraneous load as much as possible. The focus about Cognitive Load, during the planning and design, was mostly on intrinsic and extraneous load rather then germane load, mostly because the goal was on the content rather then the student, that is, focus on making small learning steps with guidance and feedback capability in an variability problem environment. Germane load is considerered in CLT as the mental resources dedicated to processing, constructing, and automating schemas, so it was considered that the dual framework of intrinsic and extraneous load is sufficient and non-redundant, making the boundaries of the procedure not so overwhelming and more clearer for the concrete content creation and implementation (Kalyuga, 2011).

While down I outline a procedure for implementing the 4C/ID design, it's crucial to understand that the process is not linear. Instead, there's a continuous feedback loop inbetween these numbered steps.

1. When drawing the map, in the horizontal, analog the time-line, the map follows a **concrete-to-abstract** task classes (TC), each one having to promote the aquisition of higher level conceptual schemas and mental models, integrating a component of a whole-task in a real-world-problem context; before hand, there is the SI that is always available. Along with the SI it was also showned the assessment criteria;
2. In the vertical, down in **complexity**, within each LT, there are all the media activities organized by PTP/PI, JIT and feedback; some of this has also some quiz with feedback associated;
3. In the planing moments the goals/skills were identifyed and classified as **recurrent** and **non-recurrent**;
4. For the each goal it was assigned a LT within the same **real-world** based problem but with a high **variability**;
5. Then group the LT in TC: the criteria used was that they must have the same knowledge support and the same non-recurrent skills; they were organized in time taking in account the degree of dificulty; 
6. **Sequencing** TC: from the easy (more simple, pratical and concrete) to the dificult (more abstract);
7. Sequencing LT: from the easy (more simple) to the dificult (more complex, requiring more interrelationship between knowledge);
8. For each LT there was a MOODLE Lesson or a classroom activity: in the last years, it became available H5P (H5P, https://h5p.org/), a set of interactive media activities that allows richer HTML5 content in existing publishing platforms;
9. Identify **simultaneity** in diferent/same LT, i.e., it happens that the several LT can have the same recurrent goals: we can choose three ways: (a) we use the LT to reinforce the goal; (b) or we keep it, noticing that the correspondent goal is used in a diferent problem; (c) or remove it;
10. Identify **anchors**: previously knowledge/skill already trained that is remembered as a prior-knowledge that will support this LT; if there is a negative feedback the student can be advised to visit the former activity;
11. For each identified recurrent goal it is assigned a PTP and JIT/PI in order to promote **automatization**;
12. Apply **scafolding** for each PTP and each LT;
13. Verify if for each non-recurrent goal, there is a TC in a variability problem setting;
14. Define **assessment** and **feedback** content and time location withing the model;
15. Define criteria for feedback and **progression**;
16. Categorize each TC with a **knowledge level** for the final **classification**.
17. In the cmaptools mind map, there are identified all the media activities needed; after is completion, they were tested and included in the LMS;
18. Later on, all of the TC and LT where identified has gaming levels and feedback was integrated for each media activity failure or sucess;
19. For each activity, it was given a time of completion in order to measure the effort needed for each task and addapt to the classes time table;
20. The activities were available weekly, allowing the students to view not all at the same time but in shunks of material to complete;
21. Allow students to give feedback about their experience and identify errors, like, links that don't work or take them to activities already passed or to much ahead.

The MOODLE activities used where the LESSON, ASSIGNMENTS, H5P activities, embeded VIDEO in those activities, Quizzes (TRANSFER Tests), FEEDBACK and activities used but that didn't have much sucess, FORUM discussions, WIKI and GLOSSARY.

# ABSTRACT

This study investigates the impact of shifting from deductive to inductive teaching methods within a bLearning environment for young science and technology students. While research on specific educational methodologies is extensive, this analysis focuses on a particular strategic change – a move towards an inductive approach, as advocated by Felder (1993).

Our findings suggest that, within the constraints of our sample, a 4C/ID bLearning approach does not consistently outperform Direct Instruction across all outcomes. However, we observed significant positive impacts on Lab Practice skills. Conversely, effects on school success and learning transfer were less pronounced, and we found a negative impact on social skills. These differential effects were observed across student demographics, with female students, ninth-graders, and those better adapted to school environments demonstrating greater benefits.

This research highlights the need for careful consideration when implementing such a pedagogical shift. We discuss the specific implications for teachers, policymakers, and school administrators, acknowledging the potential challenges and benefits associated with this transition. Our analysis is based on 12 years of teacher data (2003-2017), providing insights into the impact on Learning Transfer, Lab Practice, Social Skills, and Academic Results.

# GOALS, RESEARCH QUESTIONS and HYPOTHESIS

The **main goal** is to understand the impact of changing from Direct Instruction (Merrill, 2007) to Van Merriënboer 's Inductive Methodology Four Component Instructional (4C/ID) (van Van Merriënboer , Kirschner, 2007) in a bLearning setting using MOODLE as a Learning Managment System (LMS)(Cole, 2005)(Rice, 2006). 

This analysis spread out in four learning outcomes areas, Learning Transfer, Lab Practice, Social Skills and Academic with this boradening **research questions** guiding the process: 
1. What is the impact for the students learning outcomes?
2. Who benefits more?
3. What are the pros and cons about this methodological strategic decision?
4. What are the implications for the stakeholders?

The **hypothesis** is that this change will have an overall positive impact in the learning outcomes mentioned, because it's based on the 4C/ID methodology **'brain friendly'**, anchored on Brain Based Learning (BBL)(Jensen, 2005)(Sylvester,1995), Cognitive Load Theory (CLT)(Plass, Moreno, Brünken, 2010), Multi-Intelligence Theory (MIT)(Gardner, 2011) and Multimedia Learning Principles (MLP)(Mayer, 2005), learning theories well established. Adding to this there is a robust research and development linking the Cognitive Architecture and Instructional Design, bringing the Neuroscience research principles more near the educational settings (Sweller, 1998). Other examples of this are the MLP and CLT refered before. For the stakeholders it will give some guidelines for better support the teaching work, not only in efficiency but also in the learning design and strategies implementation (Kirschner,2002).

# THEORY

**Shortly and resumedly**, from CLT theoretical structures, in the design of the bLearning activities, envolved mostly Worked example, completion, split-attention, modality, guidance, fading and interactiv elements in the classroom and in the LMS MOODLE. Students differences were indirectly considerer by the fact that the teacher had more time to follow and interact with the student while he/she was completing the bLearning tasks builtin the LMS. The 4C/ID was choosen because of is alignment with the basic principles of complex learning, namely the elaboration theory and the real based problem learning scenarios (Plass et all, 2010, p.123). This instructional design was also connected to the human cognitive architecture as a need for consistent strategy (Sweller, van Merrienboer, J.J.G., Paas, 1998). Inspite of the fact that this 4C/ID was designed for a training program for complex skills (van Merrienboer, Clark, Croock, 2002) the author reasoning that this should be applied to Science teaching of young students to bLearning environment, for two  main reasons: one is the inductive strategy, more addapted to the human cognitive structure and the other, the fact that, its components are well defined given confidence for the work planning and the content production.

The **framework** of this theory is the Evolutionary Educational Psicology that's consideres learning as the transfer of information and schema knowledge structures into the long-term memory, following the work of John Sweeler (see is interview to the Knowledge Society CEO, Elena Douglas in 2023, available on Youtube): learning always involves integrating new information with existing knowledge structures, also meaning, the aquisition and automation of schematics knowledge (Paas et al., 2010, p.51). Schemas means patterns of stable relationships between stored knowledge, building new schematic knowledge using old ones in the long-term memory (Plass et al., 2010, p.38). So, effective instructional methods should always be tuned up to the students existing schematic pre-knowledge base to minimize working memory load processing (Paas et al., 2010, p.51).

Merril organized learning in **five prescriptive principles** (Merrill, 2002) that he noticed that they were common among several instructional design learning that, actually, are integrated in 4C/ID instructional design by Van Merriënboer  and colleagues, namely, "(a) Learning is promoted when learners are engaged in solving real-world problems. (b) Learning is promoted when existing knowledge is activated as a foundation for new knowledge. (c) Learning is promoted when new knowledge is demonstrated to the learner. (d) Learning is promoted when new knowledge is applied by the learner. (e) Learning is promoted when new knowledge is integrated into the learner's world." It is crucial to note, as highlighted by Van  Merriënboer, that his 4C/ID model effectively integrates both instructivist and constructivist methodologies across its various stages (van Merrienboer, Clark, Croock, 2002). Also important is the fact that this model **doesn't provide guidelines** for the transition from the design phase to the posterior phases of production and development. He suggest some raw media classification as primary and secondary to distinguish from supportive information to interactive media, respectively, to be used in the LMS embedded learning activities:

|    Primary media     | Secondary media | JIT (just-in-time) information |Part-task practice|
|:----------------:|-------------------------------------------|:---------------:|:---------------:|
| Problem-based; simulation-based; scenario-based;| books; hypertext; lectures; video;|help; pop-up menus;ballons;|computer practice interactive media; worked-examples|

Sweller (Plass et al., 2010, '.35) resume all of this: "CLT is concerned with how information held in long-term memory of instructors can be borrowed for use by learners via schema aquisition". In 2019 this authors resume the theory after 20 years of work referenciating the major effects and adding new ones (Sweller, van Van Merriënboer , J.J.G., Paas, 2019). In this work, the focus was on the major strategies but integrating some effects, namely, Element Interactivity, Expertise Reversal and Guidance-Fading.

# PROCEDURE (work in progress)

**In practice**, remembering what the authors of 4C/ID start to make the analogy of this learning design with an ocean liner (van Merrienboer, Clark, Croock, 2002): "huge, slow, poderous, and recuring larges amoounts of energy and a great deal of time to move...". All this work toke a lot of effort, including all the prodedure underlying the pedagogic planning: reading, testing, reading and searching, and reading again. The **4C/ID** of Merrionboer has a steep learning curve but it provides a consistent lighthouse during all the process, meaning a consistent managment of instructional sequences. This model provides the methodology for analysis of complex cognitive skills and development of appropriate sequences of whole-tasks learning situations that support gradual aqcquisition of these skills in a cognitively sustained manner. The procedure takes into account the limited processing capacity of working memory by gradually increasing the level of difficulty of whole tasks. 
According to this methodology, learning tasks for complex environments are organized in simple to complex sequence of task classe, with gradually dimishing levels of support within each class (scafolding). Suficient supportive information is provided for general aspects of learning tasks, and just-in-time information engage students in automation for the learning goals. 
Also part-time-task-practice is offered to train constituent skills that needed to be performed at a very high level of automaticity, Kalyuga (Pass et all, 2010). Moreover, this all methodoly also followed a concrete-to-abstract partner promoting the aquisition of higher level of conceptual schemas. About the load, the focus, during the planning, was on intrinsic and extraneous load rather then germane load, mostly because the goal was on the content rather then the student, that is, focus on making small learning steps with guidance and feedback capability in an variability problem environment. Germane load is considerered in CLT as the mental resources dedicated to processing, constructing, and automating schemas, so it was considered that the dual framework of intrinsic and extraneous load is sufficient and non-redundant, making the boundaries of the procedure not so overwhelming and more clearer for the concrete content creation and implementation (Kalyuga, 2011).

# STATE OF THE ART (writing work about to start)

# CONTEXT and DATA

This work is based on real day-to-day teacher assessment data, for junior and junior high students of two different schools, from different regions and time periods, for the chemistry and physics subjects of the Portuguese curriculum.

The data was gathered over 12 years, in the period 2003 to 2017, and includes students **Learning Transfer**, **Lab Practice**, **Classroom Behavior** (Social Skills), and **Academic Results** using four different random variables: TEST, LAB, BEHAV and CLASS.

The **motivation** lies on the need to understand the impact of the professional strategic decision within the educational work developed (flow charts, [^readme-2]): 

> Was it worth it? Did students benefit? What can be done better? What conclusions can be drawned?

[^readme-2]: <https://cmap.ihmc.us/>

Most of the time the professional, specific, **day-to-day teacher work** data (see figure 2) is rarely or never investigated, at least, in the Portuguese educational environment. For the teachers, there is little or no time to look back and work through the data results, the qualitative remarks, or through the statistics. And, as a consequence, no robust conclusions are devised and worse, it's normal not to share it.

## Variables description

[^readme-3]: RANK1 if CLASS variable is less than 45%; RANK 3 if CLASS variable is more then 70% and RANK 2 for the rest.

## Time series

Figure 1 shows the variable longitudinal time patterns, with box plots for variables, TEST, LAB, BEHAV and CLASS: it includes junior and junior high grade students data for both schools.

The red vertical line shows the school change year and the blue one is the starting point for the implementation of 4C/ID strategic inductive methodology, the **treatment group**. Its clear that near each vertical line there is a change showed by the blue smooth line (polynomial local regression): around 2012, the first year of 4C/ID implementation, so something happened!

The box plots in figure 1 shows, not only that the samples are not normal distributed, but also they are skewed, has same outliers and are not symmetric. Further analysis confirms this: samples are independent, not symmetric, and don't have the same variances and shapes. However, some few sample for the CLASS and TEST variables where normal distributed.

# METHODS

The **statistical analysis**, made with R code software in the RStudio[^readme-4] IDE release and the principal method is the non-parametric inferential group treatment effect with non-paired sign-rank Wilcoxon procedure with the respective assumptions analysis: samples independence, non-normality distribution, symmetry, shape and variances. Since the majority of the samples don't foloow this assumptions, they have the same variances, don't have the same shapes and symmetry is broken, and, in some cases, there are low observations, \< 50, sample permutation test was also used. Sample independence was tested with Kendall procedure.

The same analysis, the same sequence and tests, was done using several samples (figure 2). So, the idea is to suppose that the correct result must be **'in the middle'** of this extremes, or at least, to considered the all those results: in one end it was used **"all sample"** and in the other end, the same sample, but without **school and behavior effect** (this last one, for the years 2016 and 2017, see figure 1).

# RESULTS

Figure 2 and 3 shows the median changes between control and treatment group, for each variables TEST, LAB, BEHAV and CLASS (see legend). Samples are presented on the y-axis. The left of the x-axis present the negative changes and on the right the positive: the horizontal lines means no changes detected.

The idea is to analyse the results considering both extremes results, all sample and school 1 - 2014 sample. The first shows a more unfavorable scenario while the former a better one. So, moving up on the y-axis of figure 2 graph, demonstrates that the results are turning to be more favorable to the educational 4C/ID methodological change. There are two clear results: BEHAV has an overall negative change and LAB and overall positive. Furthermore, CLASS and TEST, both has an overall positive change but in less degree (figure 3). 

Introducing the school differences (school effect), the negative change persist in the BEHAV variable. If the sample is reduced until 2014 only, then BEHAV starts to have a "no change"" to a "positive change", and there is a positive change for all educational areas: this means get reed of school effect and behavior effect on the two last years, 2016 and 2017. In this sample, figure 3, the biggest positive change is for the LAB variable, CLASS and TEST are the next ones, while BEHAV has only a positive change in school 1 - 2014 sample. 

[^5results]: complete results with sample obs., stats values and p-values are on the code files, for now.

Figure 2: 4C/ID group treatment effect from 2003 to 2017.

Figure 3 shows that that impact on the median change is clearly positive for the LAB variable followed by the CLASS and TEST variable and negative for the first four samples for BEHAV.

Figure 4 and 5 shows a resume of the **results**, with much more specific samples about GRADE, GENDER or RANK, in the time period 2003 to 2017. Clearly, there is an overall **positive change** for the LAB variable while a **negative change** for BEHAV (except for GRADE 9, RANK 3 and FEMALE samples). Similarly for the variable TEST, except for JUNIOR HIGH,GRADE 7 and 8, RANK 1 and 3, and FEMALE, no changes detected. Variable CLASS shows a mixture: in the samples JUNIOR and FEMALE there is a positive change, while negative for RANK 2 and MALE and no change for the other samples. BEHAV and LAB confirm the pattern already identified above. CLASS, has a overall positive change except for RANK 2 and MALE samples while TEST just has negative changes except for MALE, RANK 1 and 2, GRADE 9, JUNIOR and all sample.

| didn't benefit | benefit more | Notes |
| --- |---| ---|
|the RANK 1 and males | Females and RANK 3 ||
| Grade 8 | Grade 9 ||
| Junior High | junior | lower level of obs. for junior high sample |

Figure 5 presents the score change between the two groups, treatment and control. The LAB variables shows the biggest positive change while BEHAV and TEST shows the worst negative change. CLASS as a mixture behavior. Samples groups that present more negative changes are MALE and RANK 2. On the other, FEMALE and RANK 3 show positive change.

Figure 5: 4C/ID group treatment effect variables change for all period of time: 2003 to 2017.

On Figures 6 and 7 shows the analysis with a sample that doesn't include the school and behavior effects. So, there is a more favorable overall positive change between control and treatment group. For RANK 1, MALE there is a less benefit results, as well as for BEHAV variable that continues to show negative change. For GRADE 8 there is a positive overall, except for BEHAV variable. There is a clear positive change for FEMALE, RANK 3 and genders 7 and 9, with RANK2 sowing a positive change on teh LAB variable, and no change on the others variables.

Figure 7 presents the score median change between the groups treatment and control for school 1 junior grade sample until 2014: there is an overall positive change with the LAB variables showing the biggest while BEHAV shows a negative change for GRADE 8, RANK 1 and MALE samples. CLASS shows the second biggest change followed by TEST and BEHAV. So, the results are not drastically different.

## Qualitative Results

The nost importante results more important can be resumed like this:

  1. Students show a lot of motivation while working online with a LMS MOODLE organized with game levels, anchors points, instantaneous feedback and activities for automation procedures;
  2. The MOODLE environment provide moments of procedural automation;
  2. During the online period of work the teacher as more time to support students specific needs;
  3. The amount of work of planning, constructing and improving the online lessons is overwhelming for a teacher alone.

# CONCLUSION

> NOTE 1: **guidelines**: what impact for the students learning outcomes (four)? Who benefits more? What are the pros and cons about this methodological decision? What are the implications for the stakeholders? Is it worth it? Do students benefit? What can be done better? What conclusions can be drawned?

> NOTE 2: the conclusions presented here focus on the "mean" results between the less favorable results of figures 2 and 3 and the more favorable of figures 4 and 5.

> NOTE 3: the Direct Instruction (Merrill, 2007) instructional design is a well established learning strategy with a overwhelming research background, some authors claim, with 200 years of history. 

Before hand, we've to outline that the comparison is made to a well developed, well established and researched instructional design theory for over more then 200 years. Any slight improve is considered very strong. 

So, **Overall**, as a teacher of science and tech, you should (or at least think about it) move to implement the inductive strategy as your methodology for learning, because it has an overall positive impact on the learning outcomes analysed in this work, namely, **Learning Transfer**,  **Social Skills** and **academic results**, when the sample is clear of the school and behavior effect. 

Clearly, there is a strong positive impact for **Lab Practice** while some of the analysis show a negative impact for **Social Skills**. For **Academic Results** and **Learning Transfer** there is a less positive impact compared to **lab practice**. 

Students that **benefit** more are females, grade 7, grade 9, junior high and the more adapted to the school system while, the one's that **don't benefit** are the less adapted to the school system and males. The other groups, grade 8, overall junior grade benefit less.

**Bottom line**, if you don't want to take the risks, change your methodology conditional to have a class group more adapted to school or if you want to increase the lab practices skills in some subject or school context, and if you have an engaged team for the bLearning implementation.

4C/ID is the methodology that works very well if the lab practice is a nuclear goal and/or your students are well adapted to school. However, in each moment there is a need for social skills classroom management. Same students claim about the inductive strategy because they like to have a manual to follow learning content in order to organize their work. So, its important to deliver a resume of the classroom content of the day.

On the other end, bLearning has a crucial benefit, it provides more individual time interaction between student and teacher which improves student engagement and motivation. While students are working online, during the classroom, the teacher can reply to specific student questions.

Implementing a bLearning system is a overwhelming task for a teacher alone because there is a huge amount of work to overcome: planning, designing, organizing and delivering the online course; afterwards there is a need to updating it, admnistrating, messaging with students, developing and correcting: team work is crucial.

Another thing that has to be acknowledge by the **stakeholders** is the fact that this change is overwhelming for one teacher alone: there is a crucial need to a commited, motivated and goal-oriented team work. However, the motivation cannot came from a external decision but must be driven by a inner group necessity. 

Furthermore, of course **one methodology** is not a panacea for all of the learning process, but having an educational theory is very important to develop and adapt to your educational context. There is also a need for stimulating research and spread the knowledge about the specific impacts of each strategy.

# DISCUSSION

Overall, *inductive methodology* has a positive impact on learning, as evidenced by various studies. Inductive methods, which involve learning through specific observations and problem-solving before introducing theories, have been shown to be more effective than traditional deductive methods in many educational contexts. Namely, better academic learning of classroom subject matter where observed. The review and meta-analysis summarizes the results of 74 training experiments with nearly 3,600 children. (Kauler and Phye, 2008). Furthermore, reports show that deductive methodologies contribute for students leaving the sciences and give a strong support for inductive teaching methods that encourage students to adopt a deep approach to learning and are precursors of intellectual development (Prince, Felder, 2007). A 4C/ID learning environment promotes the development of technical expertise in secondary technical education better than direct instruction (Sarfo, Elen, 2007).

This work aligns with research that shows, despite the strength of the evidence varies from one method to another, inductive methods are consistently found to be at least equal to, and in general more effective than, traditional deductive methods for achieving a broad range of learning outcomes (Prince, Felder, 2006). Other studies shows a high impact on performance (d = 0.79 standard deviations) for 4C/ID educational programs, suggesting that is use should be prioritized in college and university learning environments (Costa, Miranda, Melo, 2021). More detailed works show better results for groups that whole-task based in 4C/ID instructional desing on a skill acquisition test and a transfer test (Lim, Reiser, Olina, 2009). Event in computer programming course there is a description of benefits of using inductive (Khan et al., 2020) and also in grammar (Kaur, Niwas, 2016).

There was a big difference regards to gender, female getting more benefits of 4C/ID methodologies and bLearning then males.

**Further research** should include the develop of the same setting in other educational contexts, national and international, in order to confirm these findings and an analysis of the reason for the behavior declining over 2016. These work should be improved by including inference analysis that take in account samples with no symmetry, difference variances and different distribution shapes. Also, there should be done a regression and cluster analysis as a way to confirm the results and conclusions presented here, as a feedback strategy results confirmation.

**Aside from the quantitative results**, it was seen that bLearning systems provide the time to the teacher to interact more efectively during the process, tackling the individual problem for each student. So, one possibility for further research is to question the importance of this bLearning in the teaching-student interaction enhancement. Of course, adaptatively is the "holly Graal" of this bLearning systems. Further research on how to adjust the student prior-knowledge and is subject cognitve hability should be usefull to choose the best task class (see Plass et all, 2010, p.127) and cope with the expertise reversal effect. Another point, crucial for 4C/ID instructional, is the procedural automation process, identifyed and implemented in the MOODLE LMS system but not quantified, but it should be a line of research also.

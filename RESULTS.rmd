# RESULTS

Sample are independent, and generaly not normal

#variables description
#ID: Identification entry row data;
#DATE: year of the sample: it belongs, actually to 2003/2004, lective year;
#SCHOOL: there are two schools, identified by 0 (till 2008) and 1 (after 2009);
# GENDER: F and M
#TEST, LAB, BEHAV: variables of the score in the tests and observational forms at LAB (Laboratory practical skills assessment)
# and BEHAV related to accomplishement school rules behavior
# LAB work and Behavior, normally if they follow the rules stablished at school
# GRADE: categories 0 to 6, representing, respectively, 7,8,9,10,11, 10p(techical) and 11p (Technical) 
# M4CID, category 0 and 1, respectively, without 4C/ID and with 4CID;
# CLASS, 0 to 100, height average, CLASS=0.5*TEST+0.3*LAB+0.2*BEHAV: 
#this will be used in a variable to be defined below, RANK: a study for student addaptation to the school system

#Table 1: Variable description

#Inference (and independency analysis)
#Inference for the global differences in M4CID, no matter which school, for each data variables: TEST, LAB and BEHAV

# Along the way, sample independency will be tested and non normality will be considered

#Inference conclusion for the 4C/ID treatment effect for all sample, 
# no matter which school, for each data variables: TEST, LAB, BEHAV and CLASS
# Samples are independent, Wilcoxon inference non-parametric test
# for the global TEST and BEHAV, negative 4CID effect
# no effect for CLASS variable;
# LAB variable, positive effect

#Table 9: independency and Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction

#Hypothesis: does the patterns showned in the last graphs where there was a negative bump during the transition to the second 
#between the schools showed earlier in the graphs should be considered?
#Is there a school effect on the results?
#should the data between schools in the same 4CID conditions 0 be assessed? yes,
#but only the junior school should be compared
#we should use the CLASS to study the differences between schools and not the other
#variables; if we use the variable because it is a math relation qith the others
# just with class variable

#Inference for the differences in schools, without 4CID, for each variable: TEST, LAB, BEHAV and CLASS

#Conclusion
#Variable TEST, LAB, CLASS greater in school 0 then in school 1
#Variable BEHAV is less for the School 0 then in the school 1
# So, this pivotal moment, take this research to consider that 
#there is a school effect, that biased all variables, in the negative way except
#for the BEHAV variable, in the positive way for school 1. So this is going to be restricted to school 1:
# it is considered an analysis for the school 1 as a global data sample,
# and an analysis only at the junior level in school 1. Secondary school wil 
#not be analized because there is no scondary sample with no 4CID.

#be added to the sample of school 1 the differences computed in this variables. In the case of the variable BEHAV, 
# it will be added to school 0, in order to not create negative numbers, consequently, to keep the variables between 0 and 100;

# sample with only junior grade for both schools
# NOTE: the values of TEST, LAB and CLASS are over 100%: I think its not a problem because tehre is a need to compare

########## REGRESSION ANALYSIS

# Regression discontinuity design (RDD)
#"The regression discontinuity model was created to deal with one very specific type 
#of selection - cases where people have to qualify for the program, and the criteria 
#for qualification is a measure that is highly correlated with performance. 
#Some threshold is created and all people that score above the threshold are accepted 
#into the program, and all people below are not allowed to participate, or vice-versa."
# Regression discontinuity is used to solve this problem and assess whether or not we 
# observe a treatment effect. It does so by accounting for the relationship between 
#the outcome and the rating variable and then calculating the difference between the 
#ntwo groups.
#SOURCE: https://ds4ps.org/pe4ps-textbook/docs/p-060-reg-discontinuity.html

#Figure 16: Regression analysis by 4C/ID treatment effect 
# looking to the plots (see bellow) its clear that there is no linear model that explinais the data
# RDD s just to verify discontinuities in 2013. At least for the BEAHV and CLASS variable there a discontinuity
# looking at all plots it seems thta there is a change around 2013

# NOTES
Figure 2 and the next table present a resume of the **results**. The values showed represent changes in the variables median.

![Figure 2: Boxplot time series](Figures/Figure2_BoxplotTimeSeries.png)

Figure 2 shows in the y-axis the name of the samples and the x-axis show the median differences for each sample in four variables already described: TEST, LAB, BEHAV and CLASS. The variables change, represented by colors (see legend), between treatment group and control group are presented on the left of the graph if there is a negative impact and in the right if there is a positive 4C/ID impact. There is a vertical line with x equal to zero, meaning that there is no 4C/ID impact.

Looking into the graph there are two groups of results that stands: blue and green. The first means that there is a positive treatment effect for the Lab Practice and the latter means that there is a overall negative impact for the social skills: in this case only the GRADE 9 students seems to have a positive impact and no effect for FEMALE students. The TEST variable shows a tendency towards no impact with a few positive and negative. For the CLASS, Academic Results there a tendecy towards no effect to a slight negative one.

Looking into the sample JUNIOR SCHOOL 1 (sample with grades 7, 8 and 9 for school 1) that seems to be more reliable for three reasons:most **robust and reliable sample** used in this work: in fact the sample is much larger. So, they show results about the JUNIOR sample for SCHOOL 1, which means:

  1. Not having the school effect differences;
  2. The sample has students with the same age;
  3. It doesn't have the problem of using the less numbered entrances of the junior high students sample.

The next table resumes the former graph in another order: it shows the percentage of "positive", "negative" and "no effect" results, detected for each sample.

## Qualitative results 

The qualitative results show students more motivated, teacher with more individual time but a crucial need for team work among teachers.

## Quantitative
From this session on, the tables presented, details all the specific results from the analysis statistical methods used. Remember that, in this work, the Treatment effect implies the presence of the methodology 4C/ID, variable M4CID =1: the control sample, implies direct instruction methodology, signalized with M4CID = 0;

Discussion: schools are different in all of the variables, so it's
better to use school 1 only to assess the 4C/ID effect.

## Inference for SCHOOL 1, RANKS 1, 2, and 3, with or without 4C/ID

There is no scientific justification to construct the categories around
de column CLASS with these definitions:

Just comparing the schools to double-check for the differences in
schools in competence/adaptation edu system

Conclusion: it seems that students in school 0 are more adapted than
those in school 1.

This qualitative and quantitative data will be analyzed recurring to
usual statistical analysis and gather qualitative data to reinforce the
main goals of the work.

What others have done and how what you doing fits that The work done so
far shows that the results are not clear. Well normally, the results on
the social side are never a clear 80%. In this case, we are happy if
things are 60% positive.

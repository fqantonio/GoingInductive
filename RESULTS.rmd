## Quantitative

Treatment, implies the presence of the methodology 4C/ID, signalized
with 1; control, implies direct instruction methodology, signalized with
0;

Alternative: true location shift is greater than 0; Using boxplot two
compare means, knowing that what is shown is the median; Using paired
default in Wilcox stats, means, FALSE;

Effect column meaning: positive - The use of methodology 4C/ID has the
same effect on the mean, increasing the mean Negative - The use of
methodology 4C/ID has the same negative effect on the mean, decreasing
the mean No effect - The use of methodology 4C/ID had no effect on the
mean, with no increase or decrease the mean

A sample analysis with 100 entries is also done and referred to whenever
the results are contradictory.

Hypothesis: does the patterns showned in the last graphs where there was
a negative bump during the transition to the second between the schools
showed earlier in the graphs should be considered? Is there a school
effect on the results? should the data between schools in the same 4CID
conditions 0 be assessed? yes, but only the junior school should be
compared we should use the CLASS to study the differences between
schools and not the other variables; if we use the variable because it
is a math relation qith the others just with class variable Variable
TEST, LAB, CLASS greater in school 0 then in school 1 Variable BEHAV is
less for the School 0 then in the school 1 So, this pivotal moment, take
this research to consider that there is a school effect, that biased all
variables, in the negative way except for the BEHAV variable, in the
positive way for school 1. So this is going to be restricted to school
1: it is considered an analysis for the school 1 as a global data
sample, and an analysis only at the junior level in school 1. Secondary
school wil not be analized because there is no scondary sample with no
4CID.\
SCHOOL efect Inference sample analysis, 4C/ID, taking in account the
school effect prepararing the sample to take into account the
differences; in the case of TEST, LAB and CLASS, it will be added to the
sample of school 1 the differences computed in this variables. In the
case of the variable BEHAV, it will be added to school 0, in order to
not create negative numbers, consequently, to keep the variables between
0 and 100; compare data_junior_computed compare samples after the
computation explained just now: data_JUNIOR_SCHOOL0 and
data_junior_computed_SCHOOL1_M4CID0: are they from the same
distribution? Conlusion: yes, they are from the same sample distribution

Only RANK 3, the more adapted, benefit more with the 4CID methodology
RANK 1 and 2, the less adapted benefit only on the LAB variable; Female,
averall, benefit more

Discussion: schools are different in all of the variables, so it's
better to use school 1 only to assess the 4C/ID effect.

## Inference for SCHOOL 1, RANKS 1, 2, and 3, with or without 4C/ID

There is no scientific justification to construct the categories around
de column CLASS with these definitions:

| categories | condition (CLASS) | RANK | \% data school 1 (683 entries) | \% data school 0 (474 entries)\^\* |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1          | =\<55%            | 1    | 34% (229)                      | 16% (76)                           |
| 2          | 55-70%            | 2    | 41 % (281)                     | 39% (186)                          |
| 3          | \>=70             | 3    | 25 % (173)                     | 45% (212)                          |

Just comparing the schools to double-check for the differences in
schools in competence/adaptation edu system

Conclusion: it seems that students in school 0 are more adapted than
those in school 1.

## Using a sampling of 68 entries

There are several different results: should I use a for statement, for
the no effect result????

This qualitative and quantitative data will be analyzed recurring to
usual statistical analysis and gather qualitative data to reinforce the
main goals of the work.

What others have done and how what you doing fits that The work done so
far shows that the results are not clear. Well normally, the results on
the social side are never a clear 80%. In this case, we are happy if
things are 60% positive.

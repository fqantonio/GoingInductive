Merril organized learning in **five prescriptive principles** (Merrill, 2002) that he noticed that they were common among several instructional design learning that, actually, are integrated in 4C/ID instructional design by Van Merriënboer  and colleagues, namely, "(a) Learning is promoted when learners are engaged in solving real-world problems. (b) Learning is promoted when existing knowledge is activated as a foundation for new knowledge. (c) Learning is promoted when new knowledge is demonstrated to the learner. (d) Learning is promoted when new knowledge is applied by the learner. (e) Learning is promoted when new knowledge is integrated into the learner's world." It is crucial to note, as highlighted by Van  Merriënboer, that his 4C/ID model effectively integrates both instructivist and constructivist methodologies across its various stages (van Merrienboer, Clark, Croock, 2002). Also important is the fact that this model **doesn't provide guidelines** for the transition from the design phase to the posterior phases of production and development. He suggest some raw media classification as primary and secondary to distinguish from supportive information to interactive media, respectively, to be used in the LMS embedded learning activities:

|    Primary media     | Secondary media | JIT (just-in-time) information | Part-task practice |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------: | --------------------: | --------------------: |
| Problem-based; simulation-based; scenario-based; | books; hypertext; lectures; video; | help; pop-up menus;ballons; | computer practice interactive media; worked-examples; completion problems |

Sweller (Plass et al., 2010, '.35) resume all of this: "CLT is concerned with how information held in long-term memory of instructors can be borrowed for use by learners via schema aquisition". In 2019 this authors resume the theory after 20 years of work referenciating the major effects and adding new ones (Sweller, van Van Merriënboer , J.J.G., Paas, 2019). In this work, the focus was on the major strategies but integrating some effects, namely, Element Interactivity, Expertise Reversal and Guidance-Fading. All the theories underlying this work, from BBL to MI, are resumed on CLT principles and strategies that drain into 4C/ID that provide a clear and concrete procedure, used in this work, as a reference lighthouse, that considerer the way humans process information and how the cognition mind works. So, people learning systems includes dual channels, limited working memory capacity and learner active processing during learning, namely, selecting information, processing and integrating it in existing knowledge. Deeper in the 4C/ID follows the principles of elaboration theroy of Reigeluth and learning-by-doing paradigm of Schank (Plass et all, 2010, p.126).

The very basic strategy of taking care of the **amount of information and cognitive load** (Kalyuga in Plass el al., 2010, p.50) within each online and presential activity was considerer: the intrinsic, the extraneous and germane loads are concepts to be aware in the process of preparing and using 
the educational materials. Added to this was also the strategy of **gamification**: putting levels of achievement and **feedback** that took the learner in a learning path that considerer the knowledge mastered: expertive reversal effect, (Plass et al., 2010, p.96). **Worked-Out-examples** was one of the strategies implemented as well as, **self-explanations** and **faded work-out steps**. 

Non of this was addapted to students prior knowledge nor **germane load** was considered. **Prior knowledge** also was not considered in detail but only in the usual broader sense where students that attend the class were novices to Science and Tech and completed the previous grade. 

A central idea, already mentioned, is the mental model aquisition that is accomplished by the Kalyuga (Plass et al. 2010, p.56) schema aquisition procedure which is very hard to achieve in every learner whatever student in whatever content. So, schema aquisition need **automation** in order to get to higher order of expertise reducing cognitive load. So, small chunks of activities where put in place in order to construct the higher order knowledge puzzle. 
Included were also the **multimedia principles** of dual information in video and media presentations. In all of the activities the **guidance** was always provided along with fading until students where able to solve the problem autonomously. 

**Principles** like the direct initial instruction principle and the small step-size of knowledge principles were taking in account but not the expertise principle, mostly because, only in same exceptions, students of a higher degree of understanding of the content were attending this intended novice lectures. 
Of course, the information store principle (the cognitive system has a large store of information, the long-term memory); borrowing and reorganizing principle (almost all information in long-term memory was borrowed from other long-term memory and aquired by imitation), listening or reading; in a schema theory the 
learner don't remember everything but the knowledge is soterd in a schema struture: learning also includes the aquisition and automation of schema using; automation of lower level schema is needed for the high levell schema aquisition. Randomness as genesis principle is for comunicating information only, it does indicates that random generation of information followed by test of effectiveness provide the initial source of generation of all the information in the long-term memory; meaning, when face with a new problem random generation of activities moves forward by tests of effectiveness; Change principle, meaning, all changes in long-term memory ocurr slowly and incrementally (wroking memory limitations): so, we can conclude that learners producing information is inefective. Finnaly, organizing and linking principle: unlimited organized long-term memory can be used for the nteractions with the natural world. 
Added to this prinicple was the variation of contexts of the problems proposed. Multimedia principles were not forgeted, not only in the video editing but also in the animation interactiv films and simulations produced and organized by PHET animations and LMS Lesson MOODLE activity. Namely, guided activity, feedback, reflection principle (plass et all, p.166) and multimedia principle, already mentioned.
 
For the material on the LMS MOODLE, used during the class and could be used online, the Mayer and Moreno (Plass et all, 2010, p.142-148) multimedia principles for extraneous cognitive load, namely coherence, redundancy, signaling, teporal and spacial contiguity. For the intrinsic load, segmenting,
pretraining and modality were considered in the material prepared (Mayer, 2005, p.169-200).

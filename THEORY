All the theories underlying this work, from BBL to MI, are resumed on CLT and, finnaly on the 4C/ID that provide a clear procedure, used in this work, as a reference lighthouse, that considerer the way humans process information and how the cognition mind works. From CLT it was considered the very basic strategy of taking care of the **amount of information and cognitive load** (Kalyuga in Plass el al., 2010, p.50) within each online and presential activity: the intrinsic, the extraneous and germane loads are concepts to be aware in the process of preparing and using the educational materials. Added to this was also the strategy of **gamification**: putting levels of achievement and **feedback** that took the learner in a learning path that considerer the knowledge mastered: expertive reversal effect, (Plass et al., 2010, p.96). **Worked-Out-examples** was one of the strategies implemented as well as, 
**self-explanations** and **faded work-out steps**. 

Non of this was addapted to students prior knowledge nor **germane load** was considered. **Prior knowledge** also was not considered in detail but only in the usual broader sense where students that attend the class completed the previous grade. 

A central idea, already mentioned, is the mental model aquisition that is accomplished by the Kalyuga (Plass et al. 2010, p.56) schema aquisition procedure which is very hard to achieve in every learner whatever student in whatever content. So, schema aquisition need **automation** in order to get to higher order of expertise reducing cognitive load. So, small chunks of activities where put in place in order to construct the higher order knowledge puzzle. Included were also the **multimedia principles** of dual information in video and media presentations. In all of the activities the **guidance** was always provided along with fading until students where able to solve the problem autonomously. 

**Principles** like the direct initial instruction principle and the small step-size of knowledge principles were taking in account but not the expertise principle, mostly because, only in same exceptions, students of a higher degree of understanding of the content were attending this intended novice lectures. Of course, the information store principle (the cognitive system has a large store of information, the long-term memory); borrowing and reorganizing principle (almost all information in long-term memory was borrowed from other long-term memory and aquired by imitation), listening or reading; in a schema theory the learner don't remember everything but the knowledge is soterd in a schema struture: learning also includes the aquisition and automation of schema using; automation of lower level schema is needed for the high levell schema aquisition. Randomness as genesis principle is for comunicating information only, it does 
indicates that random generation of information followed by test of effectiveness provide the initial source of generation of all the information in the long-term memory; meaning, when face with a new problem random generation of activities moves forward by tests of effectiveness; Change principle, meaning, all changes in long-term memory ocurr slowly and incrementally (wroking memory limitations): so, we can conclude that learners producing information is inefective. Finnaly, organizing and linking principle: unlimited organized long-term memory can be used for the interactions with the natural world. Added to this prinicple was the variation of contexts of the problems proposed. Multimedia principles were not forgeted, not only in the video editing but also in the animation interactiv films and simulations produced and organized by PHET animations and LMS Lesson MOODLE activity. Namely, guided activity, feedback, 
reflection principle (plass et all, p.166) and multimedia principle, already mentioned.

4C/ID follows the principles of elaboration theroy of Reigeluth and learning by doing paradigm of Schank (Plass et all, 2010, p.126).

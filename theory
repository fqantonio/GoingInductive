All the theories underlying this work, from BBL to MI, are resumed on CLT and, finnaly on the 4C/ID that provide a clear procedure, used in this work, as a reference lighthouse, 
that considerer the way humans process information and how the cognition mind works. From CLT it was considered the very basic strategy of taking care of the **amount of information 
and cognitive load** (Kalyuga in Plass el al., 2010, p.50) within each online and presential activity: the intrinsic, the extraneous and germane loads are concepts to be aware in the 
process of preparing and using the educational materials. Added to this was also the strategy of **gamification**: putting levels of achievement and **feedback** that took the learner 
in a learning path that considerer the knowledge mastered: expertive reversal effect, (Plass et al., 2010, p.96). **Worked-Out-examples** was one of the strategies implemented as well as, 
**self-explanations** and **faded work-out steps**. 

Non of this was addapted to students prior knowledge nor **germane load** was considered. **Prior knowledge** also was not considered in detail but only in the usual broader sense where 
students that attend the class completed the previous grade. 

A central idea, already mentioned, is the mental model aquisition that is accomplished by the Kalyuga (Plass et al. 2010, p.56) schema aquisition procedure which is very hard to achieve 
in every learner whatever student in whatever content. So, schema aquisition need **automation** in order to get to higher order of expertise reducing cognitive load. So, small chunks of 
activities where put in place in order to construct the higher order knowledge puzzle. Included were also the **multimedia principles** of dual information in video and media presentations. 
In all of the activities the **guidance** was always provided along with fading until students where able to solve the problem autonomously. 

**Principles** like the direct initial instruction principle and the small step-size of knowledge principles were taking in account but not the expertise principle, mostly because, only 
in same exceptions, students of a higher degree of understanding of the content were attending this intended novice lectures. Of course, the information store principle (the cognitive system 
has a large store of information, the long-term memory); borrowing and reorganizing principle (almost all information in long-term memory was borrowed from other long-term memory and aquired 
by imitation), listening or reading; in a schema theory the learner don't remember everything but the knowledge is soterd in a schema struture: learning also includes the aquisition and 
automation of schema using; automation of lower level schema is needed for the high levell schema aquisition. Randomness as genesis principle is for comunicating information only, it does 
indicates that random generation of information followed by test of effectiveness provide the initial source of generation of all the information in the long-term memory; meaning, when face 
with a new problem random generation of activities moves forward by tests of effectiveness; Change principle, meaning, all changes in long-term memory ocurr slowly and incrementally 
(wroking memory limitations): so, we can conclude that learners producing information is inefective. Finnaly, organizing and linking principle: unlimited organized long-term memory can 
be used for the interactions with the natural world. Added to this prinicple was the variation of contexts of the problems proposed. Multimedia principles were not forgeted, not only in 
the video editing but also in the animation interactiv films and simulations produced and organized by PHET animations and LMS Lesson MOODLE activity. Namely, guided activity, feedback, 
reflection principle (plass et all, p.166) and multimedia principle, already mentioned.

**In practice**, the prodedure underlying of the pedagogic planning, was the **4C/ID** of Merrionboer that provides a consistent means of managment of instructional sequences. This model 
provides the methodology for analysis of complex cognitive skills and development of appropriate sequences of whole-tasks learning situations that support gradual aqcquisition of these 
skills in a cognitively sustained manner. The procedure takes into account the limited processing capacity of working memory by gradually increasing the level of difficulty of whole tasks. 
According to this methodology, learning tasks for complex environments are organized in simple to complex sequence of task classe, with gradually dimishing levels of support within each 
class (scafolding). Suficient supportive information is provided for general aspects of learning tasks, and just-in-time information engage students in automation for the learning goals. 
Also part-time-task-practce is offered to train constituent skills that needed to be performed at a very high level of automaticity, Kalyuga (Pass et all, 2010). Moreover, this all 
methodoly also followed a concrete-to-abstract partner promoting the aquisition of higher level of conceptual schemas. During the planning the focus was on intrinsic and extraneous load 
rather then germane load, mostly because the goal was focus on the content rather then the student, that is, focus on making small learning steps with guidance and feedback capability 
in an variability problem environment. Germane load is considerered in CLT as the mental resources dedicated to processing, constructing, and automating schemas, so the dual framework of 
intrinsic and extraneous load is sufficient and non-redundant, making the boundaries of the theory clearer and the also the concrete field implementation (Kalyuga, 2011).

The **procedure** taken for the instructional design of this bLearning enviroment setting was done with cmap tools ([My Cmaps Cloud](https://cmapcloud.ihmc.us/cmaps/myCmaps.html)). The maps conceived contains the 4C/ID theoretical structure in the first step that was developed after a first trial for a real but small learning structure which was used to reelaborate that theoretical setting that followed several feedback loops until that 4C/ID structure was clear to be used for a first real learning course. Of course, each time the 4C/ID cmap was used in a new course or learning content some adjustments were made but just with the idea of making easire a clearer the use of those theoretical 4C/ID maps. Those maps contains all the guides proposed by 4C/ID of MerriÃ«nboer, already embeded in the CLT theory, and they show the two main lines of work while using them: in time, with the broadening of practice, concrete activities towards concepts and conceptualization, new problems and contexts, with the idea of schema learning, step by step, in small amounts with supportive information; and down, meaning, showing the possible paths, fullfilled with just in time information, fading guidance, promoting procedure automation, into the increasing complexity of the subject.
